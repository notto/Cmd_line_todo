This is just a simple command line to-do list I hacked together during a couple of classes.

It takes a file to read from and write to as its sole command-line argument.  Items are
separated by newlines, so any files passed will be read as such.

Provided you have gcc installed, navigate to the correct directory and compile with:

g++ workQueue.cpp

Run with:

./<executable name> <To-do list file name>
